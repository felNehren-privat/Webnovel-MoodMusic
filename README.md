Webnovel-MoodMusic - How to use

-- This is an early version, there will be plenty of bugs. I mainly made this for private use so code is not pretty or well written. It definitely is not secure to expose the api, you should probably only execute it locally.

----DO NOT INSTALL RANDOM EXTENSIONS IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS DOING. Be careful even if you are installing it from the chrome store.----

1. Install forked backend suno api with custom route: https://github.com/felNehren-privat/suno-api
2. Add suno api cookie to .env according to instructions.
3. Add chatgpt api-token to .env
4. Add random request-token to .env
5. Install node, npm install and run backend api

6. Download moodMusic extension and add to chrome.
7. Add api and previously set request-token to settings.
8. Add url or part of url to check for and (class)-selector. It currently only works with class selectors and takes all content of child elements.
9. Save and reopen once.

10. Press generate or activate autoplay. It takes around 20-30 seconds to generate a fitting song.
